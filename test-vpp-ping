Inside VM CLI (vppctl):
=======================

#first block of commands
sh int		#show interfaces	
sh int address	#show interfaces addresses	
sh ip arp 
sh ip fib
sh err

#show packet traces (should be empty)
sh trace

#log traces
trace add dpdk-input 10

#assign private IP and "up" interface 
set int ip address GigabitEthernet0/8/0 172.28.128.3/24 #because host machine "vboxnet0" interface is 172.28.128.1
set int state GigabitEthernet0/8/0 up

#PING on host machine

#repeat first block to display changes

#show packet traces (should see ping packets)
sh trace

#restart vpp service to reset interfaces
